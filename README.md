# Clustering-in-Uber-Dataset

New York City consists of 5 boroughs:Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Bronx, and Staten Island. The objective of this project is to analyse and understand traffic in different boroughs of NYC and categorise various zones within boroughs as Office destination, residential destination, popular brunch destination, party destination according to its popularity given the time range and the day of the week.

Dataset Used is available at Kaggle under the heading 'Uber Pickups in New York City',provided by user 'FiveThirtyEight'. It contains data on over 4.5 million Uber pickups in New York City from April to September 2014, and 14.3 million more Uber pickups from January to June 2015.

There is a lot of information stored in the traffic flow data of any city. This data when mined over location can provide information about the major attractions of the city, it can help usunderstand the various zones of the city such as residential areas, office/school zones, highways,etc. This can help governments and other institutes plan the city better and enforce suitablerules and regulations accordingly. For example, a different speed limit in school and residential zone than compared to highway.

The data when monitored over time can help us identify rush hours, holiday season, impact of weather, etc. This knowledge can be applied for better planning and traffic management. This can at a large, impact the eciency of the people in the city and can also help avoid
disasters, or at least faster redirection of traffic flow after accidents.
